                <h3>uberAgent ESA: Precision in Threat Detection</h3>
                <p>With uberAgent Endpoint Security Analytics (ESA), monitoring system activities becomes not just
                    possible, but also intuitive and efficient. By creating a detailed trace of system activities,
                    uberAgent ESA turns the complexity of threat detection into a streamlined process.</p>

                <h3>Intelligent Rule Matching</h3>
                <p>uberAgent ESA's power lies in its sophisticated rule matching system. Whether it's a suspicious
                    process, an abnormal network connection, or other indicators of risk, uberAgent ESA efficiently
                    flags such activities. Each detection translates into an event within your Security Information and
                    Event Management (SIEM) system, like Splunk, ensuring you're alerted to potential threats in
                    real-time.</p>

                <h3>uAQL: The Core of uberAgent's Rule Engine</h3>
                <p>The foundation of Threat Detection's effectiveness is uAQL (uberAgent Query Language), an advanced
                    yet readable query language designed for both human clarity and machine speed. This synergy of
                    ease-of-use and performance is what makes uberAgent ESA's ruleset both robust and user-friendly.</p>

                <h3>Predefined and Customizable Rules</h3>
                <p>Armed with hundreds of predefined rules targeting widespread attack vectors, plus the ability to
                    import Sysmon rules and Sigma signatures, uberAgent ESA is versatile out of the box. Users are
                    encouraged to tailor and expand upon the existing ruleset to fit their unique security landscape.
                </p>

                <h3>Rule Provenance and Storage</h3>
                <p>uberAgent ESA benefits from a dual-source rule pool: meticulously crafted vast limits rules and
                    converted third-party rules, such as those from the Sigma project. All Threat Detection rules are
                    accessible and maintained within the uberAgent Configuration GitHub repository, ensuring
                    transparency and ease of updates.</p>

                <h3>Enhanced with Metadata</h3>
                <p>Each rule in uberAgent ESA is enriched with metadata, providing additional context such as MITRE
                    ATT&CK technique IDs, and each event is tagged with a risk score for better assessment and
                    prioritization.</p>

                <h3>Seamless Integration and Visualization</h3>
                <p>The events detected by uberAgent ESA are not just logged but also visualized within the Threat
                    Detection Events dashboard. Integrated within the uberAgent_ESA Splunk searchhead app, this feature
                    provides a comprehensive and actionable overview of security events.</p>

                <h3 class="card-title">What's Sigma?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a
                    straightforward manner. It is designed to be both flexible and easy to write, with applicability to
                    any type of log file.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of the Sigma project is to create a structured way for researchers and analysts to
                    document their detection methods once developed and share them with the community. This facilitates
                    a collaborative approach to threat detection and enhances collective security knowledge.</p>
                <p>In the world of digital forensics, Sigma's role is analogous to what Snort represents for network
                    traffic analysis, and YARA for file analysis. It is a critical tool for the creation of sharable,
                    scalable, and systematic rule sets for log event analysis.</p>
